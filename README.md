Create a user_credentials.properties file in src/resources/ and populate with the user passwords. <br>
Format: <br>
<ul>
<li>password.user1=XXX</li>
<li>password.user2=XXX</li>
<li>password.user3=XXX</li>
<li>password.user4=XXX</li>
<li>password.user5=XXX</li>
</ul>
The fourjcore package just contains code that I wrote to access the Twitter API. <br>
I initially started with misunderstanding the task and assumed we had to retrieve and post 
Tweets to our Twitter account. It works but its outside the scope.
